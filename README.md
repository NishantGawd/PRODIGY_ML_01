# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It was completed as Task 1 of the **Prodigy Infotech ML Internship**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- **Objective**: Predict house prices using key features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.  
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).  
- **Model**: Linear Regression (supervised learning).  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)  
- **NumPy** (Numerical operations)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Model training, evaluation)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Visualization)  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Scaled features for better model performance.  
2. **Model Training**:  
   - Split data into train/test sets.  
   - Trained Linear Regression model.  
3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Used metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.  
   - Visualized predictions vs. actual values.
